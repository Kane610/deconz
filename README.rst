deCONZ |Chat Status|
====================
Python library wrapping `deCONZ Rest API`_ for Home-Assistant.

This implementation should cover most devices supported by deCONZ, if that is not the case please create an issue with debug logs and we will get it supported.

Only host address and API key are necessary for normal operations.
